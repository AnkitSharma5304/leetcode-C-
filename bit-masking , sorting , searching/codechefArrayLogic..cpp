Sure, let's go through the code step by step to understand its functionality and purpose.

Code Walkthrough
Reading Input for Multiple Test Cases:

cpp
Copy code
int t;
cin >> t;
while(t--){
The code begins by reading the number of test cases t.
It then enters a loop to process each test case.
Reading Array Size and Elements:

//cpp
Copy code
int n;
cin >> n;
n = n * 2;
long long arr[n];
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    cin >> arr[i];
}
For each test case, the code reads the integer n which represents half the number of elements in the array.
It then multiplies n by 2 to get the total number of elements in the array.
An array arr of size 2 * n is declared, and the elements are read into this array.
Counting and Summing Logic:

cpp
Copy code
int count = 0;
long long ans = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    if(arr[i] > n / 2){
        count++;
    } else {
        ans = ans + count;
    }
}
cout << ans << endl;
Two variables count and ans are initialized to zero.
The code then iterates through the array.
For each element in the array:
If the element is greater than n / 2 (which is n in the original problem size before doubling), count is incremented.
If the element is not greater than n / 2, the current value of count is added to ans.
After processing the array, the result stored in ans is printed.
Explanation of Logic
The array is processed in a single pass, counting how many elements are greater than half the total number of elements n / 2.
Each time an element that is not greater than n / 2 is encountered, it adds the current count of elements greater than n / 2 to ans.
Essentially, this logic seems to be counting the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The count variable keeps track of the number of elements greater than n / 2 encountered so far, and for each element not greater than n / 2, it adds this count to ans, effectively counting these pairs.
Practical Example
Let's go through an example to illustrate:

Input:

Copy code
1
3
5 3 6 2 1 4
Processing:

Here n = 3, and after doubling, n = 6.
Array: [5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4]
The threshold for comparison is n / 2 = 3.
Iteration through the array:
5 > 3: Increment count to 1
3 <= 3: Add count (which is 1) to ans, making ans = 1
6 > 3: Increment count to 2
2 <= 3: Add count (which is 2) to ans, making ans = 3
1 <= 3: Add count (which is 2) to ans, making ans = 5
4 > 3: Increment count to 3
Result: ans = 5
The output for this test case would be 5.

This code efficiently counts certain pairs in the array based on the given logic, leveraging the properties of counting and cumulative sums.
