An unordered_map in C++ is a container that stores elements formed by the combination of a key value and a mapped value. It is part of the C++ Standard Library, introduced in C++11. Unlike the map container, which keeps its elements ordered by the keys, unordered_map does not guarantee any specific order of the elements.

Here are the key features and details about unordered_map:

Characteristics
Hash Table-Based: unordered_map is implemented using a hash table, which allows for average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. This is typically faster than a tree-based map (std::map), which has O(log n) complexity.

Key Uniqueness: Each key in an unordered_map is unique. If an attempt is made to insert an element with a key that already exists, the existing value will not be overwritten (unless explicitly done using specific member functions).

No Specific Order: As the name implies, there is no ordering of the elements. The elements are organized into buckets based on their hash values.

Bucket: The hash table used by unordered_map consists of several "buckets." Each bucket can contain multiple elements in the case of hash collisions (where multiple keys have the same hash value).

Key Functions and Operations
Insertion:

insert: Adds a new element. If the key already exists, the insertion is ignored.
emplace: Constructs elements in place and is generally more efficient than insert because it avoids unnecessary copying.
cpp
Copy code
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> umap;
    umap.insert({"apple", 1});
    umap.emplace("banana", 2);
    return 0;
}
Access:

operator[]: Provides access to the element with the specified key, inserting a default-constructed element if the key does not exist.
at: Provides access to the element with bounds checking; throws an exception if the key does not exist.
cpp
Copy code
std::cout << umap["apple"];  // Output: 1
std::cout << umap.at("banana");  // Output: 2
Removal:

erase: Removes elements either by key or by iterator.
cpp
Copy code
umap.erase("apple");
Searching:

find: Searches for an element with a specific key and returns an iterator to it or end if the key is not found.
cpp
Copy code
auto it = umap.find("banana");
if (it != umap.end()) {
    std::cout << "Found: " << it->first << " -> " << it->second;
}
Size and Capacity:

size: Returns the number of elements.
empty: Checks if the container is empty.
bucket_count: Returns the number of buckets.
cpp
Copy code
std::cout << umap.size();  // Output: 1 (after erasing "apple")
Custom Hash Functions
You can define custom hash functions and equality functions if the key type is a user-defined type or if a different hash/equality behavior is needed.

cpp
Copy code
struct Key {
    std::string first;
    std::string second;

    bool operator==(const Key& other) const {
        return first == other.first && second == other.second;
    }
};

struct KeyHash {
    std::size_t operator()(const Key& k) const {
        return std::hash<std::string>()(k.first) ^ std::hash<std::string>()(k.second);
    }
};

std::unordered_map<Key, int, KeyHash> custom_map;
Example
Here's a complete example demonstrating the usage of unordered_map:

cpp
Copy code
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> umap;

    // Inserting elements
    umap["apple"] = 1;
    umap.insert({"banana", 2});
    umap.emplace("cherry", 3);

    // Accessing elements
    std::cout << "apple: " << umap["apple"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "banana: " << umap.at("banana") << std::endl;

    // Checking if key exists
    if (umap.find("cherry") != umap.end()) {
        std::cout << "cherry is in the map" << std::endl;
    }

    // Iterating through the unordered_map
    for (const auto& pair : umap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    // Removing an element
    umap.erase("apple");

    // Checking the size
    std::cout << "Size of the map: " << umap.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
Conclusion
unordered_map is a powerful container when you need fast access to elements using keys without caring about the order. Its performance characteristics make it suitable for many use cases, especially where the order of elements is not a concern.
