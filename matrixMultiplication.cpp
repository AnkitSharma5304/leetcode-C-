Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in computer science and mathematics. To multiply two matrices 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B to produce a matrix 
𝐶
C, you need to follow the rules of matrix multiplication.

Let's break down the algorithm and then provide a detailed C++ implementation.

Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication
Given two matrices 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, the product matrix 
𝐶
C is computed as follows:

Matrix Dimensions:

Let 
𝐴
A be an 
𝑚
×
𝑛
m×n matrix.
Let 
𝐵
B be an 
𝑛
×
𝑝
n×p matrix.
The resulting matrix 
𝐶
C will be an 
𝑚
×
𝑝
m×p matrix.
Matrix Multiplication Formula:

Each element 
𝐶
[
𝑖
]
[
𝑗
]
C[i][j] in matrix 
𝐶
C is computed as:
𝐶
[

[
𝑗

𝐵
[

]
[
𝑗
]
C[i][j]= 
k=0
∑
n−1
​
 A[i][k]×B[k][j]
This involves summing the products of corresponding elements from the 
𝑖
i-th row of matrix 
𝐴
A and the 
𝑗
j-th column of matrix 
𝐵
B.

    int A[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE], B[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE], C[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE];
    int m, n, p;

    // Input dimensions
    std::cout << "Enter dimensions for matrix A (m x n): ";
    std::cin >> m >> n;
    std::cout << "Enter dimensions for matrix B (n x p): ";
    std::cin >> n >> p;

    std::cout << "Enter elements of matrix A:" << std::endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {

    std::cout << "Enter elements of matrix B:" << std::endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {

        }
    }

    // Multiply matrices
    multiplyMatrices(A, B, C, m, n, p);

    // Output the result
    std::cout << "Resultant matrix C:" << std::endl;
    printMatrix(C, m, p);

    return 0;

Explanation
Header Inclusions:

#include <iostream> is used for input and output operations.
Functions:

multiplyMatrices: Computes the product of matrices 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B and stores the result in matrix 
𝐶
C. It uses three nested loops to perform the multiplication and summation.
printMatrix: Prints the elements of a matrix in a formatted manner.
Main Function:

Reads dimensions and elements of matrices 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.
Calls multiplyMatrices to compute the product.
Calls printMatrix to display the result.
Note
The MAX_SIZE constant should be adjusted based on the maximum expected matrix size. In practice, using dynamic memory allocation (e.g., with std::vector) is often preferable for handling larger or variable-sized matrices.
Error checking (e.g., verifying if the matrices can be multiplied) is omitted here for simplicity but should be included in a complete implementation.
