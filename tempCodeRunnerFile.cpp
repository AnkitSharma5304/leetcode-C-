LeetCode 560, titled "Subarray Sum Equals K," is a problem that asks you to find the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to a given integer 
// ùëò
// k. Let's walk through the solution in C++ in detail.

// Problem Description
// You are given an array of integers nums and an integer k, and you need to return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

// Example
// cpp
// Copy code
// Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
// Output: 2
// Approach
// To solve this problem efficiently, you can use a hashmap (or unordered_map in C++) to store the cumulative sum up to each index. The key idea is to use the cumulative sum and check how many times a particular cumulative sum has appeared.

// Key Concepts
// Cumulative Sum: This is the sum of elements from the start of the array up to the current index.
// HashMap Usage: Use a hashmap to store the cumulative sum and its frequency of occurrence.
// Algorithm Steps
// Initialize a hashmap to store the cumulative sum and its frequency.
// Initialize variables: count to store the number of subarrays, sum to store the cumulative sum.
// Iterate through the array and update the cumulative sum.
// For each element, check if sum - k exists in the hashmap. If it does, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index which sums to k.
// Update the hashmap with the current cumulative sum.
// Code Implementation
// Here's the detailed C++ implementation:
