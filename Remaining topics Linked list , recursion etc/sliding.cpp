Problem Understanding
The task is to find the maximum length of a substring that can be made equal by changing characters in s to t, where each change has a cost equal to the absolute difference between the corresponding characters in s and t, and the total cost must not exceed maxCost.

Issues in the Code
Infinite Loop: The inner while loop (while(maxCost != 0)) can lead to an infinite loop since maxCost might never become exactly zero.
Incorrect Cost Calculation: The current cost calculation is subtracting x directly, which may lead to negative values for maxCost.
Logic to Find the Maximum Length: The logic does not correctly handle the sliding window approach which is needed to find the maximum substring length under the cost constraint.
Revised Approach
We should use a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of the substring with the given cost constraints. The sliding window helps maintain a window of characters where the total cost is less than or equal to maxCost.

Here's the corrected and improved code:

cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int currentCost = 0;
        int start = 0;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); ++end) {
            // Calculate the cost of changing s[end] to t[end]
            currentCost += abs(s[end] - t[end]);
            
            // If currentCost exceeds maxCost, shrink the window from the left
            while (currentCost > maxCost) {
                currentCost -= abs(s[start] - t[start]);
                start++;
            }
            
            // Update the maximum length of the valid window
            maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
Explanation of the Corrected Code
Initialization:

maxLength to keep track of the maximum length of the valid substring.
currentCost to keep track of the current cost of the window.
start to denote the starting index of the window.
Sliding Window:

Traverse through each character of the string s using end.
Add the cost of changing s[end] to t[end] to currentCost.
If currentCost exceeds maxCost, shrink the window from the left by incrementing start and subtracting the cost of the change from currentCost.
Update Maximum Length:

After adjusting the window size, update maxLength with the size of the current valid window.
This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum length substring with the allowed cost using a sliding window technique.
