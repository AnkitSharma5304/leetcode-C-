A 2D vector is essentially a vector of vectors. It is used in many programming scenarios where you need to handle data in a matrix-like format. In C++, a 2D vector is created using the vector class from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Here’s a detailed explanation:

Definition and Initialization
A 2D vector can be defined and initialized in multiple ways:

Empty 2D vector:

cpp
Copy code
vector<vector<int>> vec;
2D vector with predefined size:

cpp
Copy code
int rows = 3;
int cols = 4;
vector<vector<int>> vec(rows, vector<int>(cols));
2D vector with predefined size and initial value:

cpp
Copy code
int rows = 3;
int cols = 4;
int initial_value = 0;
vector<vector<int>> vec(rows, vector<int>(cols, initial_value));
Accessing Elements
Elements in a 2D vector can be accessed using the [] operator or the at method. For example:

cpp
Copy code
vec[0][1] = 5;  // Using the [] operator
int value = vec.at(0).at(1);  // Using the at() method
Iterating Over Elements
You can iterate over the elements of a 2D vector using nested loops:

cpp
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < vec[i].size(); j++) {
        cout << vec[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
Dynamic Resizing
2D vectors can be dynamically resized using the push_back method:

cpp
Copy code
vector<int> row = {1, 2, 3};
vec.push_back(row);  // Add a new row

vec[0].push_back(4);  // Add a new element to an existing row
Common Operations
Insert a row:

cpp
Copy code
vector<int> newRow = {1, 2, 3};
vec.insert(vec.begin() + 1, newRow);  // Insert at position 1
Delete a row:

cpp
Copy code
vec.erase(vec.begin() + 1);  // Delete the row at position 1
Clear all elements:

cpp
Copy code
vec.clear();
Example Usage
Here’s a complete example that demonstrates creating, initializing, and manipulating a 2D vector:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int rows = 3;
    int cols = 4;
    vector<vector<int>> vec(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));

    // Set values
    vec[0][0] = 1;
    vec[1][2] = 2;
    vec[2][3] = 3;

    // Print the 2D vector
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < vec[i].size(); j++) {
            cout << vec[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
This example initializes a 3x4 2D vector with zeros, sets specific values, and prints the 2D vector.

Applications
2D vectors are widely used in various applications such as:

Matrices: Representing mathematical matrices.
Grids: Simulating 2D grids or maps, for example, in games or simulations.
Dynamic Arrays: When the size of the array needs to change dynamically during runtime.
Understanding and efficiently using 2D vectors can greatly help in solving many problems in competitive programming and software development.
